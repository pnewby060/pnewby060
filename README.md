## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome!
My name is **Philip Newby** and i'm from South Tyneside, United Kingdom studying ðŸ“– **BSc (Honours) Computing and IT** with the Open University.

I am currently working within a warehouse environment which I do enjoy. In my spare time I like to learn and code and my favourites are OOP such as **Java, Python** and **JS** but I like to learn anything when it comes to programming. I am currently learning towards the **Cybersecurity** path and would like to develop skills to be able to get to the stage of **Offensive Security, Pen Testing, Mobile Forensics** etc.
